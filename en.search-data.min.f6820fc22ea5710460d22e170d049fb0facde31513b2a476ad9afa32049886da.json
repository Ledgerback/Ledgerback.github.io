For more information on the model, strategic plan, and background readings, please read the NC2I Google Doc. The NC2I is still a work-in-progress so any comments or other feedback is much appreciated.\nInstitutional Model\r#\r\rThe NC2I is a model for building a digital cooperatively-owned and -governed institute (\u0026ldquo;research cooperative\u0026rdquo;) to scaffold the human-centric side of the frontier, connect academia, industry and society, sustainably steward knowledge-based resources and tools, and expand the ability for anyone to generate, access, use and build upon knowledge from the frontiers. knowledge about the frontier. The NC2I builds upon the institutional forms of an independent scholar institute, cooperative, and tech nonprofit, and is inspired by other initiatives for new kinds of research organizations such as Focused Research Organizations, Private ARPA, etc.\nFor background, a research cooperative (i.e., community-owned research institute) is a purpose-built, values-driven, and people-centered environment for research, development, education, and/or commercialization, generally oriented towards the social good or public interest.\nStrategic Plan\r#\r\rThese initiatives (described as programs) are ways to approach growing the LDCRC as an institution.\nThe programs are:\n  Cottage Program: obtain cloud infrastructure, tax-exempt status, basic membership base, team development, and early-stage funding\n  Connectivity Program: connecting LDCRC to other people and entities at the frontier, develop an audience-research fit, and develop fruitful partnerships\n  Library Program: initiative to crowdsource data, intelligence and knowledge into databases (or directories) for discovery engines to support research, decision-making, education, and participation at the frontier.\n  The initiatives are for building the institute\u0026rsquo;s internal capacity, further implementing the NC2I model, have the LDCRC seen as a valuable research resource, and developing the LDCRC\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem through a portfolio of projects.\nTheory of Change\r#\r\rThrough our work, we will:\n  narrow the time between when discoveries are made at the frontiers of technology, science, and society (“frontier”) and when they are disseminated to the public,\n  expand the talent pool of people who can participate in research (or curiosity-driven exploration or self-directed research) at the frontier\n  spread awareness of human-centric futures (or narratives of such things) into discussions regarding the frontier\n  spread awareness of or develop sustainable and equitable models for value generation and distribution of data-, information-, and knowledge-based resources and tools\n  Values\r#\r\r  Solution-agnostic\n  Interdependence\n  Maximum creativity\n  Thoughtfulness\n  Constantly learning   Have fun\n  Optimism\n  Open Science\n  Team\r#\r\r Charles Adjovu  You can find Charles\u0026rsquo;s digital garden here   Jack Smye Marvin Roman Joseph Tobing Darick Velasco Joshua Davila  Advisory Board\r#\r\r Jan Zygmuntowski Dr. Sarah Manski Patricio Guerpe Morshed Mannan  Code of Conduct\r#\r\rYou may find our Code of Conduct here.\n Identity\r#\r\rName\r#\r\rLedgerback is a combination of \u0026ldquo;ledger\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;back.\u0026rdquo; Ledger comes from the term Distributed Ledgers (which is often used interchangeably with blockchain). Back comes from the slang term \u0026ldquo;greenback.\u0026rdquo;\nThe term is meant to recognize that we are currently living in a transitory period where we are re-evaluating our relationships with technologies, institutions, work, and more, and the need to identify the paradigm shifts to help understand this new world.\nWe chose \u0026ldquo;Ledgerback\u0026rdquo; based on the history of the slang term \u0026ldquo;greenback.\u0026rdquo; Greenback arose in the mid-1800s during the US Civil War as the US Federal Government started issuing paper money on green-colored paper (hence the name greenback). There was major uncertainty at the time over whether greenbacks would be recognized as banks as legal tender, how much one greenback equated to a piece of gold, and so on.\nThough this period caused some turmoil, it was a transitional period that has led to our current time where we accept that paper money has underlying value without a second thought.\nWe believe we are going through a similar transitional period, e.g., Web2 to Web3, Industry 3.0 to Industry 4.0, and that the vairous fields working on making this transition occur are at the frontier or the edge of what is currently known (i.e., the Ledgerback Frontier).\nWe believe we are going through a similar transitional period, where we are moving from soelly physical systems to digital, networked systems, especially those based on blockchains (i.e., systems that are backed by a cryptographic ledger).\nMascot\r#\r\rOur mascot is our super adorable and quick-witted stork you see in our logo, Scout Stork.

Members are encouraged to engage in collaborative and curiosity-driven research through projects that aid our understanding of the frontiers.\nThemes\r#\r\rThemes are institute-wide research topics that draw together large networks of researchers from the LDCRC and beyond.\nOur themes include:\n Data Stewardship Digital Organizations Governance and Coordination Digital Identity Metascience Future of Work Sustainability Complex Intelligence Platform Economy Tools for Thought Social Enterprises Ethical Futures Emerging Markets Meta-crisis Emerging Technologies  Papers\r#\r\rA Preliminary Review of Blockchain in the Music Industry (November 6, 2018)\r#\r\r Musicians in the music industry are the primary content creators, and yet, have little to no control over their musical works after assigning their rights and management to third party intermediaries such as record labels, performance rights organizations, and publishers. Before the rise of file sharing platforms in the 1990s, this scenario was the norm for all musicians as record labels controlled nearly all facets of the music industry from musician funding to distribution and even royalty payment collection. Many thought file sharing platforms such as Napster and LimeWire, which we deem \u0026ldquo;the first wave of disruption,\u0026rdquo; would wrestle control of the music industry from record labels to musicians, but that has not occurred as of this writing. The rise of blockchain-based interventions in the music industry, which we have termed the \u0026ldquo;second wave of disruption,\u0026rdquo; may finally lead the music industry to transition to a musician-centered ecosystem, with few if any intermediaries, and bring musicians and fans/consumers closer than ever before. Despite the various promises of blockchain technology, the use of blockchain is primed, and dare we say, destined, to change the music industry. Though, with any such change, there will be issues that must be properly managed to ease the transition from legacy systems to blockchain-based systems (\\Legacy-to-Blockchain\u0026quot;). There are many issues pioneers in this field will have to face stemming from the music industry itself and the inherent limitations of blockchain technology, but in doing so, we recommend that blockchain-based intervention projects and pioneers implement six strategies to counter these issues and bring the blockchain-based music industry into fruition.\n Blockchain-mediated Licensing: Legal Engineering for Artist Empowerment \r#\r\r Licensing is one of the essential means of exploiting the monetary value of a musical work, and yet it is an area fraught with many issues and transactional costs which make it a difficult process for individuals and organizations. Many issues in music licensing arise from the legal complexity (e.g., national and international copyright law), business complexity (authentication, tracking, accounting, etc.), value web complexity (transparency of relationships among stakeholders), and technical complexity (e.g., establishing a global repertoire database for music, sufficient metadata standards) of working with music. Then, in addition to these issues, there are specific transactional costs (identification, negotiation, monitoring, and enforcement) associated with the licensing process. To mitigate the complexity and transactional costs associated with music and the licensing process, researchers and technologists have been investigating how new technologies and design models from the Web3 space, such as blockchain, linked data and Ricardian Contracts, can automate processes to reduce complexity, speed up payments, improve tracking, and provide other benefits in the music industry. In our report, we make our own attempt to reduce the complexity and transactional costs in the licensing process by developing an automated music license. In doing so, we first conducted a literature review synthesizing the intersection of music complexity and Web3 technologies to provide background and context to automating music licensing. Then we developed the Practical Tokenized Drafting (PTD) method, a set of core principles and practices for drafting Ricardian Contracts that interact with Web3 technologies (RC-Web3 Templates), and the Tokenized Music License (TML), an RC-Web3 Template standard form for music licensing on the OpenLaw platform. Both the PTD and TML can be adapted to meet the needs of music industry stakeholders and provide guidance to legal practitioners in drafting RC-Web3 Templates.\n Blockchain and the Rise of the Internet Cooperative\r#\r\r Cooperatives and blockchain projects appear to be unrelated until a deeper look is taken into blockchain projects and their associated communities. Cooperatives and blockchain projects both promote substantially similar principles and values centered around democratic member control and the freedom for individuals to come together for their own mutual benefit. There are two types of cooperativism which expressly account for the ability for blockchain to further cooperatives, platform cooperativism and open cooperativism. Further, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), take the combination of blockchain and cooperativism even further through the cooperative management of an entity that is created on, managed on, and solely exists on a blockchain. the inner workings of blockchain make it extremely suitable for meeting the seven principles and values that unite cooperatives across the world and for expanding cooperative values and principles from local communities to global movements.\n Writings\r#\r\rYou can find our writings (e.g., blog posts) in our LDCRC base table.\nProjects\r#\r\rDatabases and Search Engines\r#\r\rObservatory\r#\r\rObservatory is a comprehensive knowledge graph and search engine to discover people, organizations, events, problems, solutions, and more pertaining to emerging technologies and how they draw attention to human-centric futures. Primarily, you can think of the Observatory as your own personal research assistant.\nThe Observatory currently tracks:\n people (scholars, entrepeneurs, technologists, etc.), organizations (research labs, etc.), problems, solutions, media (podcasts, news, etc.), events, databases, dictionary (i.e., language or vocabulary), documents, talkspaces (i.e., online communities), and tools.  You can find a preview of the base on Airtable here. Additionally, you can find a graph visualization of the dictionary here. And the alpha website for the Observatory will be posted by Q3 2022.\nMoyo\r#\r\rMoyo is an educational directory and open data platform for educational materials (content, tools, etc.) to help you learn about Web3, Platform Cooperatives, and other fields so that you can better imagine and participate in designing the future. Eventually, we hope to develop an assistive tool to help personalize learning.\nYou can find the table here. And the alpha for Moyo can be found here.\nDistroid\r#\r\rThe Distroid newsletter is a commentary and curated digest covering research, news, events, videos \u0026amp; podcasts, and more on emerging technologies and their implications for the future.\nYou can find an example table for Distroid (specifically, Issue 19) here. The alpha for Distroid will be released soon.\nMobility and Sustainability\r#\r\rBikestream\r#\r\rBikestream is a project to develop a user-owned Internet of Things (IoT) platform that allows cyclists (and logistics companies) to collect and share their electric bicycle (including battery) and location data (“mobility data”).\nPrimarily, Bikestream is meant to help develop data-driven methods to make last-mile logistics better and greener.\nYou can find the Github repo here.\nDatabike Prototype\r#\r\rAdditionally, read our Databike Report to get a better idea of our prototype databike, a converted electric bicycle with a data logger that logs geolocation and electric bicycle data, developed under the project.\nData Logging Software\r#\r\rPython and Shell programs (intended for a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ in headless mode) for manipulating and streaming vehicle and geolocation data from an electric bicycle and smartphone to Streamr in real-time.\nGovernance and Organizational Design\r#\r\rDistributed Governance Score Framework\r#\r\rThe Distributed Governance Score Framework (DGSF) is a project for developing a theoretical basis on digital organizations, especially Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), from an organization science/design perspective, and developing analytical tools to assess various aspects of digital organizations.\nDAO Index\r#\r\rThe DAO Index is an analytical tool (specifically, a self-assessment questionnaire) and open database that builds on the theoretical background to assess how a DAO is implementing a set of core organizing principles (8 as of version 0.8 of the questionnaire) that are oriented towards the community organizational form, into their governance structures and disclosures, based on publicly available information.\nFor more information about the DAO Index, please read this Hackernoon post introducing the tool, and the DAO Index Airtable base covering organization design problems, current and past versions of the questionnaire (the current version is Version 0.9), and past evaluations with the questionnaire.\nTo get a better understanding of the DAO Index, please review the DAO Index Background Knowledge quiz.\nEarly-stage concepts\r#\r\rWeb3 and Platform Cooperatives\r#\r\rSome early-stage concepts from Charles on connecting Platform Cooperativism to Web3.\n "},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/mainsito/translation/","title":"Translation","section":"LDCRC","content":"Translating research on the frontiers into actionable insights\r#\r\rThe LDCRC\u0026rsquo;s Translation Office helps organizations and individuals in industry and the public understand the frontiers and how to use the knowledge generated from the frontiers in their own projects.
