      <description>Twitter Sentiment Analysis of #daos#Analyzing the sentiment of tweets containing the hashtag &amp;lsquo;#daos&amp;rsquo;#Charles Adjovu
Apr 14

    I made some charts covering the sentiment of tweets using the hashtag #daos on Twitter. Additionally, I made a wordcloud of the tweets.
Polarity is on a scale from 1 (most positive) to -1 (most negative), with 0 being neutral. The tweets were tweeted on 2022-04-13, from ~12:52 PM to ~1:28 PM PST.</description>

      <description>Library#We’re aiming to assemble collections of academic and grey literature that would help people learn about emerging technologies and their implications for the future.
We have two main libraries, our Zotero library (primarily research literature) and our Portal database(primarily a curated list of resources about a field at the Ledgerback Frontier to help you learn the basics).
Portal#Currently, we have a curated list for Web3 that goes over the basics, and provides a critical review of claims in the Web3 field concerning decentralization, trustlessness, and other important concepts.</description>

      <description>Research#Papers#A Preliminary Review of Blockchain in the Music Industry (November 6, 2018)# Musicians in the music industry are the primary content creators, and yet, have little to no control over their musical works after assigning their rights and management to third party intermediaries such as record labels, performance rights organizations, and publishers. Before the rise of file sharing platforms in the 1990s, this scenario was the norm for all musicians as record labels controlled nearly all facets of the music industry from musician funding to distribution and even royalty payment collection.</description>

      <description>Equitable Knowledge Transfer#Through our translation program, we will work on turning our research outputs the into products for the world to use, through various avenues (e.g., IP licensing, spin-offs). Through our translation program, we want to show that our research not only provides benefits to the public, but also has commercial value. Regarding the commercial value, we hope to translate our findings through equitable commercialization options such as cooperatives and trusts so that the value generated remains with the stakeholders.</description>
