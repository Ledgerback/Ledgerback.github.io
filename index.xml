      <description>Introduction#This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static#Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/▾ images/logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/▾ static/▾ images/logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>

      <description>About#Ledgerback Research is a 501(c)(3) worker cooperative and and decentralized research lab enacting the SDCI, a model for a knowledge ecosystem.
We study and build convergence (connection and integration) (emphasis on the alternative/decentralized internet), democratic ownership models, social technology, citizen-expertise, and tools for thought (TfT).
We produce open-access research (similarly to an academic or industry lab), including scientific publications, reports, blog posts, educational videos, open-source software, and demonstrations, and with these nurture the growth of researchers.</description>

      <description>Community#Ledgerback Research is a community for genuinely curious people who are interested in getting better at learning, sharing, researching, and building democratic ownership models, networked-scholarship, networked-culture, social technology, and tools for thought (TfT) (&amp;ldquo;Topics&amp;rdquo;).
To that end, the community building aspect of Ledgerback Research is creating a place to: 1) develop and train relevant skills for maturing into a researcher or maker, 2) find kindred spirits, friends and collaborators along the way, 3) produce serious research, 4) educate each other on interesting topics, and 5) give back to society.</description>

      <description>Research#Approach#Under development.
Convergent# Convergence research is a means of solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and forming novel frameworks to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation. Convergence research is related to other forms of research that span disciplines - transdisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, and multidisciplinarity. It is the closest to transdisciplinary research which was historically viewed as the pinnacle of evolutionary integration across disciplines.</description>
