      <description>Outputs#Papers# Cooperative, Ledgerback, A Preliminary Review of Blockchain in the Music Industry (November 6, 2018). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3280838 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3280838  Musicians in the music industry are the primary content creators, and yet, have little to no control over their musical works after assigning their rights and management to third party intermediaries such as record labels, performance rights organizations, and publishers. Before the rise of file sharing platforms in the 1990s, this scenario was the norm for all musicians as record labels controlled nearly all facets of the music industry from musician funding to distribution and even royalty payment collection.</description>
