      <description>Twitter Sentiment Analysis of #daos#Analyzing the sentiment of tweets containing the hashtag &amp;lsquo;#daos&amp;rsquo;#Charles Adjovu
Apr 14

    I made some charts covering the sentiment of tweets using the hashtag #daos on Twitter. Additionally, I made a wordcloud of the tweets.
Polarity is on a scale from 1 (most positive) to -1 (most negative), with 0 being neutral. The tweets were tweeted on 2022-04-13, from ~12:52 PM to ~1:28 PM PST.</description>
