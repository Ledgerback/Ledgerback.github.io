	    <p> Ledgerback, also known as Ledgerback Cooperative, is a member-driven research, analysis and innovation cooperative for decentralized and open thinking and systems (DOTS). </p>
	    
	    	<p> We hope to research, analyze and innovate the DOTS ecosystem to assist and support DOTS-related individuals, 
		    communities, and organizations (“people”), and non-DOTs-related people to adopt, support, and assist DOTS-related 
		    initiatives, thinking, and technologies.</p>
	    
	    <h3> Careers & Opportunities </h3>
	    
	    	<p> We are always looking for new people to join us as we work on progressing the DOTS ecosystem.</p>
		<p>As a Co-operative, all of our members are also owners of Ledgerback, thereby each member has an equal stake in the affairs of Ledgerback. </p>
