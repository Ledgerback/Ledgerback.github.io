            <h2> Name </h2>
            <p class="my-lead-3"> 
              
              Ledgerback is a combination of "ledger" and "back." Ledger comes from the term Distributed Ledgers (which is often used interchangeably with blockchain). Back comes from the slang term "greenback."
              <br>
              <br>
              The word is meant to recognize that we are currently in a transitory period and identifying the paradigm shifts needed to move our current system to blockchain-based systems (though, this can be expanded to the global technological commonwealth). 
              <br>
              <br>
              We chose "Ledgerback" based on the history of the slang term "greenback." Greenback as a term arose in the mid-1800s during the US Civil War as the US Federal Government started issuing paper money on green-colored paper (hence the name greenback). There was major uncertainty at the time over whether greenbacks would be recognized as banks as legal tender, how much one greenback equated to a piece of gold, and so on. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Though this period caused some turmoil, it was a transitional period that has led to our current time where we accept paper money as money without a second thought. 
              <br>
              <br>
              We believe we are going through a similar transitional period, where we are moving from paper (physical) to distributed ledgers (digital), or to ledgerbacked systems, (i.e., systems that are built on top of blockchains and are backed and secured by the blockchain's inherent properties and a society pushed by blockchain values and thinking), and even greater than that, a global technological commonwealth.</p>
            
        
            <h2> Mascot </h2>
            <p> Our mascot is our super adorable and quick-witted stork you see in our logo, Scout Stork (SØS). Scout is scouting the world for fellow storks to flock with in gaining and disseminating knowledge to others by delivering ideas and causing paradigm-shifts across the land. </p> <!-- need background story for scout stork or someone just to write about the Scout Stork Adventures -->
            
         
            <h2> Aspects </h2>
            <p> The LedgerbackØDCRC currently consists of three different aspects:

              <ul class="list-bullets">
                <li class="mb-2"> Legal: A formal cooperative association registered in the United States with 6 operational hubs dedicated to organizing, advocacy, research and the facilitation of a knowledge commons. </li>
                <li class="mb-2">People: A community of activists, scholars, technologists, citizens, and more working at different levels of engagement; a global core team handling daily operations, organizational strategy, and long-term sustainability; and numerous supporters engaging with and contributing to our information commons, including our blog, public Wiki and Loomio groups. </li>
                <li class="mb-2"> Virtual: An ecosystem producing and sharing knowledge on the digital commons, the internet and society, and the emergence of a global technological commonwealth. </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
           
            <h2> Social Charter </h2>

          <p> In accordance with our principles, any member, individually or as part of a collective, may create their own LedgerbackØDCRC local or regional or language-based spin-off, as long as it is in accordance with our mission, guiding principles, and our status as a nonprofit research institute.
          </p>

          <h2> Guiding Principles </h2>

          <p> Our four guiding principles are: </p>

          <ul class="list-bullets">
            <li class="mb-2"> Decentralization is a spectrum, with our goal to continually decentralize our processes</li>
            <li class="mb-2"> We are in constant development </li>
            <li class="mb-2"> Transparency and Openness is the default </li>
            <li class="mb-2"> Complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity are natural occurrences </li>
            <li class="mb-2"> One-size fits all approaches are unlikely to be helpful </li>
            <li class="mb-2"> The Commons (knowledge, documentation, tools, etc.) should be freely accessible to members </li>
            <li class="mb-2"> We should strive for egalitariansim</li>
            <li class="mb-2"> Technology is a means, not necessarily an ends </li>
            <li class="mb-2"> Technology and Society are not separable </li>
          
          </ul>
