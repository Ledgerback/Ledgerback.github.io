      <description>About#Ledgerback Research is a 501(c)(3) worker cooperative and and decentralized research lab enacting the SDCI, a model for a knowledge ecosystem.
We study and build convergence (connection and integration) (emphasis on the alternative/decentralized internet), democratic ownership models, social technology, citizen-expertise, and tools for thought (TfT).
We produce open-access research (similarly to an academic or industry lab), including scientific publications, reports, blog posts, educational videos, open-source software, and demonstrations, and with these nurture the growth of researchers.</description>

      <description>Community#Ledgerback Research is a community for genuinely curious people who are interested in getting better at learning, sharing, researching, and building democratic ownership models, networked-scholarship, networked-culture, social technology, and tools for thought (TfT) (&amp;ldquo;Topics&amp;rdquo;).
To that end, the community building aspect of Ledgerback Research is creating a place to: 1) develop and train relevant skills for maturing into a researcher or maker, 2) find kindred spirits, friends and collaborators along the way, 3) produce serious research, 4) educate each other on interesting topics, and 5) give back to society.</description>

      <description>Questions#Answered#1. What is social technology?... Social technology is the hardware and software that determine how we organize and collectively live our lives. But it is also the the ideas, knowledge, economics, and institutions that drive culture and sustain societies. And it is the way this knowledge is embedded in the technologies we use.

      <description>Research#Approach#Under development.
Convergent# Convergence research is a means of solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and forming novel frameworks to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation. Convergence research is related to other forms of research that span disciplines - transdisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, and multidisciplinarity. It is the closest to transdisciplinary research which was historically viewed as the pinnacle of evolutionary integration across disciplines.</description>
