Back comes from the slang term \u0026ldquo;greenback.\u0026rdquo;\nThe term is meant to recognize that we are currently living in a transitory period where we are re-evaluating our relationships with technologies, institutions, work, and more, and the need to identify the paradigm shifts to help understand this new world.\nWe chose \u0026ldquo;Ledgerback\u0026rdquo; based on the history of the slang term \u0026ldquo;greenback.\u0026rdquo; Greenback arose in the mid-1800s during the US Civil War as the US Federal Government started issuing paper money on green-colored paper (hence the name greenback). There was major uncertainty at the time over whether greenbacks would be recognized as banks as legal tender, how much one greenback equated to a piece of gold, and so on.\nThough this period caused some turmoil, it was a transitional period that has led to our current time where we accept that paper money has underlying value without a second thought.\nWe believe we are going through a similar transitional period, e.g., Web2 to Web3, Indsutry 3.0 to Indsutry 4.0, and that the vairous fields working on making this transition occur are at the frontier or the edge of what is currently known (i.e., the Ledgerback Frontier).\nWe believe we are going through a similar transitional period, where we are moving from soelly physical systems to digital, networked systems, especially those based on blockchains (i.e., systems that are backed by a cryptographic ledger).\nMascot\r#\r\rOur mascot is our super adorable and quick-witted stork you see in our logo, Scout Stork.

What is social technology?\r...\r\r Social technology is the hardware and software that determine how we organize and collectively live our lives. But it is also the the ideas, knowledge, economics, and institutions that drive culture and sustain societies. And it is the way this knowledge is embedded in the technologies we use.\n \r\r\r\r2. What is a Tool for Thought(TfT)?\r...\r\r [A word on nomenclature: the term ‚Äútools for thought‚Äù rolls off neither the tongue nor the keyboard. What‚Äôs more, the term ‚Äútool‚Äù implies a certain narrowness. Alan Kay has arguedAgain, in Alan Kay, User Interface: A Personal View (1989), among other places. that a more powerful aim is to develop a new medium for thought. A medium such as, say, Adobe Illustrator is essentially different from any of the individual tools Illustrator contains. Such a medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that were formerly impossible for them. Speaking loosely, the range of expressive thoughts possible in such a medium is an emergent property of the elementary objects and actions in that medium. If those are well chosen, the medium expands the possible range of human thought.](https://numinous.productions/ttft/)\n \r\r\r\r2.1. What is the difference between a tool and a medium?\r...\r\r A tool is something that takes an existing workflow, and makes it more efficient. A nail is an efficient way of holding pieces of wood together; a to-do app is an efficient way of remembering your responsibilities. A medium, on the other hand, gives us new agency or power by which we can do something we couldn‚Äôt do before. As with any dichotomy, there are grey areas. Powerful, effective tools can become mediums and enablers too. The graphical computer user interface wasn‚Äôt just a better way to write scientific simulations or data processing systems ‚Äì it also became a new medium for creative work. Programming languages began history as a more efficient way to store and maintain punchcard programs, but a half-century of innovation has made it a medium for expressing programs that couldn‚Äôt be written before.\n \r\r\r\r3. What is an invisible college?\r...\r\r This ‚Äúinvisible college‚Äù is an association of people who share ideas. Who build a new reality together, then spread it to advance the wider culture.\n \r\r\r\r4. What is a platform business model?\r...\r\r What we mean with a platform business is a business model (not a technology infrastructure) that focuses on helping to facilitate interactions across a large number of participants. These interactions could take the form of short-term transactions like connecting buyers and sellers or they could involve formation of longer-term social relationships, longer-term collaboration to achieve a shared outcome or sustained efforts to accelerate performance improvement of participants by helping them to learn faster together. The role of the platform business is to provide a governance structure and a set of standards and protocols that facilitate interactions at scale so that network effects can be unleashed.\n \r\r\rOpen\r#\r\rWhat is convergence (connection \u0026amp; integration)?

Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3280838 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3280838  Musicians in the music industry are the primary content creators, and yet, have little to no control over their musical works after assigning their rights and management to third party intermediaries such as record labels, performance rights organizations, and publishers. Before the rise of file sharing platforms in the 1990s, this scenario was the norm for all musicians as record labels controlled nearly all facets of the music industry from musician funding to distribution and even royalty payment collection. Many thought file sharing platforms such as Napster and LimeWire, which we deem \u0026ldquo;the first wave of disruption,\u0026rdquo; would wrestle control of the music industry from record labels to musicians, but that has not occurred as of this writing. The rise of blockchain-based interventions in the music industry, which we have termed the \u0026ldquo;second wave of disruption,\u0026rdquo; may finally lead the music industry to transition to a musician-centered ecosystem, with few if any intermediaries, and bring musicians and fans/consumers closer than ever before. Despite the various promises of blockchain technology, the use of blockchain is primed, and dare we say, destined, to change the music industry. Though, with any such change, there will be issues that must be properly managed to ease the transition from legacy systems to blockchain-based systems (\\Legacy-to-Blockchain\u0026quot;). There are many issues pioneers in this field will have to face stemming from the music industry itself and the inherent limitations of blockchain technology, but in doing so, we recommend that blockchain-based intervention projects and pioneers implement six strategies to counter these issues and bring the blockchain-based music industry into fruition.   Adjovu, Charles and Fabian, Ewa, Blockchain-mediated Licensing: Legal Engineering for Artist Empowerment (June 3, 2020). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3625317 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3625317  Licensing is one of the essential means of exploiting the monetary value of a musical work, and yet it is an area fraught with many issues and transactional costs which make it a difficult process for individuals and organizations. Many issues in music licensing arise from the legal complexity (e.g., national and international copyright law), business complexity (authentication, tracking, accounting, etc.), value web complexity (transparency of relationships among stakeholders), and technical complexity (e.g., establishing a global repertoire database for music, sufficient metadata standards) of working with music. Then, in addition to these issues, there are specific transactional costs (identification, negotiation, monitoring, and enforcement) associated with the licensing process. To mitigate the complexity and transactional costs associated with music and the licensing process, researchers and technologists have been investigating how new technologies and design models from the Web3 space, such as blockchain, linked data and Ricardian Contracts, can automate processes to reduce complexity, speed up payments, improve tracking, and provide other benefits in the music industry. In our report, we make our own attempt to reduce the complexity and transactional costs in the licensing process by developing an automated music license. In doing so, we first conducted a literature review synthesizing the intersection of music complexity and Web3 technologies to provide background and context to automating music licensing. Then we developed the Practical Tokenized Drafting (PTD) method, a set of core principles and practices for drafting Ricardian Contracts that interact with Web3 technologies (RC-Web3 Templates), and the Tokenized Music License (TML), an RC-Web3 Template standard form for music licensing on the OpenLaw platform. Both the PTD and TML can be adapted to meet the needs of music industry stakeholders and provide guidance to legal practitioners in drafting RC-Web3 Templates.   Adjovu, Charles, Blockchain and the Rise of the Internet Cooperative (December 17, 2018). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3750540 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3750540  Cooperatives and blockchain projects appear to be unrelated until a deeper look is taken into blockchain projects and their associated communities. Cooperatives and blockchain projects both promote substantially similar principles and values centered around democratic member control and the freedom for individuals to come together for their own mutual benefit. There are two types of cooperativism which expressly account for the ability for blockchain to further cooperatives, platform cooperativism and open cooperativism. Further, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), take the combination of blockchain and cooperativism even further through the cooperative management of an entity that is created on, managed on, and solely exists on a blockchain. the inner workings of blockchain make it extremely suitable for meeting the seven principles and values that unite cooperatives across the world and for expanding cooperative values and principles from local communities to global movements.
